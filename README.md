# PythonSecuritySystem

I was inspired by the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaqFqx3wzfE and I've decided to make my own version.
I used python 3.8.6

Features:
- selecting multiple areas (max 20 corners per area as a default)
- telegram alerts
- recording when someone is in the area
